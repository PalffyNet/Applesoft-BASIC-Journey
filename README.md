AppleSoft BASIC II – Educational Programs & Examples
Overview

This repository contains AppleSoft BASIC II programs created and collected for educational and learning purposes.
The goal is to explore classic 8-bit computing, understand how software was written on early Apple II systems, and preserve knowledge of retro programming techniques.

These programs are intended to be used with real Apple II hardware or Apple II emulators (such as AppleWin).

Purpose

This project exists to:

Learn and teach AppleSoft BASIC II

Explore retro programming concepts

Preserve historical computing knowledge

Demonstrate how early games and utilities were written

Serve as a reference for students, hobbyists, and retro-computing enthusiasts

Why AppleSoft BASIC?

AppleSoft BASIC represents an important era in computing history where:

Memory was limited

Code had to be efficient

Creativity mattered more than frameworks

Learning it builds a deeper understanding of how modern programming evolved.
